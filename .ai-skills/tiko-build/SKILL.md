# tiko-build

> Tiko orchestrates, it doesn't bundle — direct access, compile-time safe,
> nothing wrapped.

This file is the **operational distillation** of
[`docs/orchestrator-model.md`](../../docs/orchestrator-model.md). The long
doc is the source of truth for prose; this file is the shape an agent reads
to act. **When adding a recipe, update both** — the table here, and the
recipe section there.

## The rule

When a user says *"I need X"*, classify X into one of three buckets:

| Bucket | What it means | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| **Core** | container, scopes, event bus, compile-time wiring, lifecycle | Use a tiko primitive directly. |
| **Plug in** | any integration with an external system (HTTP, DB, cache, templating, scheduling, retry, observability, security, SDK clients) | Bring the library; expose it as a `@Produces` value; consume as a constructor parameter. |
| **Open** | extending the event model itself (new async modes, scheduling-as-event, retry-as-loop) | File an issue. Don't invent. |

**Default if uncertain: Plug in.** Never search for "tiko's equivalent of
Spring's X" — that frame is the failure mode this skill exists to prevent.

## When in doubt, ask

If the user's prompt doesn't make the bucket obvious, **ask before
inventing**. A clarifying question is always cheaper than a wrong recipe.
Ask about:

- The lifecycle of the resource (per-request, per-app, per-event).
- Whether the user has already chosen a library.
- Whether the concern lives inside the app (Plug in) or is about extending
  tiko itself (Open).

Never fabricate a recipe for a library the user didn't name. The cookbook
below covers the canonical libraries; outside that list, ask which one to
plug in.

## Scaffolding shape

```
service/
├── pom.xml                            # tiko-api + tiko-processor + tiko-runtime + tiko-config + your libs
├── src/main/java/com/example/svc/
│   ├── AppConfig.java                 # @Configuration root record
│   ├── <Library>Factory.java          # @Produces <ThirdPartyValue>
│   ├── <Thing>Repository.java         # raw library API
│   ├── <Thing>Created.java            # domain event record
│   ├── <Thing>Auditor.java            # @EventHandler(<Thing>Created)
│   ├── <Thing>Routes.java             # plain route methods (not a @Component)
│   └── Main.java                      # Tiko.create + register routes + start
├── src/main/resources/
│   ├── application.yml                # typed-config binding
│   └── schema.sql                     # if applicable
└── src/test/java/...
```

Bootstrap pattern (`Main.java`):
```java
Container container = Tiko.create(ConfigSources.classpath("application.yml"));
Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread(container::shutdown));
var routes = new ThingRoutes(container.get(ThingRepository.class), container.getEventBus());
Javalin app = container.get(Javalin.class);
app.post("/things", routes::handleCreate);
app.start(container.get(AppConfig.class).server().port());
```

Reference shape:
[`tiko-examples/15_quickstart`](../../tiko-examples/15_quickstart).

## Cookbook table

Every recipe = one factory class. Construction shape + lifecycle is enough.

| Need | Library | Recipe |
|---|---|---|
| Connection pool | HikariCP | `@Produces DataSource` returning `HikariDataSource` (AutoCloseable — no `@PreDestroy`). |
| Schema migrations | Flyway | `@EventHandler(ApplicationStartedEvent)` calling `Flyway.configure().dataSource(ds).load().migrate()`. |
| Typed query DSL | jOOQ | `@Produces DSLContext` via `DSL.using(ds, dialect)`. No lifecycle. |
| In-process cache | Caffeine | `@Produces Cache<K,V>` via `Caffeine.newBuilder()...build()`. Named for qualifier. |
| HTTP layer | Javalin | `@Produces Javalin` + `@PreDestroy app.stop()`. Routes registered in `Main`. |
| Templates | FreeMarker | `@Produces freemarker.template.Configuration`. No lifecycle. |
| SDK client | any | `@Produces ClientType`. Add `@PreDestroy` if not `AutoCloseable`. |
| Messaging (Kafka) | tiko-kafka | Use `@KafkaSource`/`@KafkaSink`; **not** a generic `@Produces` recipe. |

See [`docs/orchestrator-model.md` §3](../../docs/orchestrator-model.md) for
the full code snippets and lifecycle notes per recipe.

## Anti-pattern redirect table

When the user reaches for a Spring reflex, route them here instead. The
redirect is what tiko **does** ship, not a "we deliberately don't wrap X"
shrug — name the tiko-native primitive.

| Spring reflex | Tiko-native primitive |
|---|---|
| `@RestController` | `@Produces Javalin` + plain route methods |
| `@Transactional` | Explicit transaction demarcation (EVENT-scoped Connection or auto-commit per call) |
| `@TransactionalEventListener` | `eventBus.publish(...)` after the write completes |
| `@Scheduled` (+ ShedLock) | `@EventHandler` on a `Tick` event published by a small scheduler thread |
| `@Async` on arbitrary methods | `@EventHandler(async = true)` for event-shaped work; `CompletableFuture` / virtual threads for ad-hoc |
| `@Retryable` | Small utility `Retry.withRetries(n, backoff, () -> op)` — visible code, no AOP |
| `@Value` | Typed `@Configuration` records via `tiko-config` |
| Spring Actuator endpoints | Routes on your HTTP layer calling `container.get(HealthChecker.class)` |
| Spring Security filter chain | Javalin `before` handler + `Context` attributes (security is the bucket least settled — see model doc §6) |

Full anti-pattern prose with code samples is in
[`docs/orchestrator-model.md` §3–§6](../../docs/orchestrator-model.md).

## What this skill does not cover

- The mechanics of writing a `@Component` or `@EventHandler` from scratch.
  Those are in `CLAUDE.md` and the API javadoc.
- Choosing between libraries (Javalin vs Spark, HikariCP vs Agroal). This
  skill names a canonical choice; swap freely if the project already has one.
- Anything outside the orchestrator model. For framework internals, read
  the source.
